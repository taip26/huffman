# huffman
Git repository for designing and testing Huffman compression algorithms to apply to memory

# 9/13
Began with a basic Huffman compression algorithm and modified it to only create a tree out of the most common 8 characters

# 9/15
Added IO functionality
Future scalability - compress multiple bit sequences!!!!!
 - start with being able to compress/decompress data rn
 - use bitmasking to compress/decompress
    - to decompress, read one bit at a time through bitwise &

# 9/20
Change IO to writing/reading to memory for faster operations
